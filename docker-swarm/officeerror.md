If you cannot find the `loolwsd.xml` file, it could be due to a couple of reasons, such as the file not being present or the installation method not creating it in the expected location. Here are some steps to locate or create the configuration file for your Collabora Online Development Edition (CODE):

### 1. Check Common Installation Locations

The `loolwsd.xml` file is typically found in one of the following directories, depending on how you installed Collabora:

- **For Debian/Ubuntu** (using APT):
  - `/etc/loolwsd/loolwsd.xml`
  
- **For Docker Installation**:
  - If you installed Collabora via Docker, the configuration might not be in a traditional filesystem location. Instead, it would be set up within the Docker container.

### 2. Find the Collabora Installation Directory

If you're unsure where Collabora is installed, try searching for the `loolwsd` executable:

```bash
which loolwsd
```

Or search for the directory containing the executable:

```bash
find / -type f -name 'loolwsd'
```

### 3. Create or Edit the Configuration File

If you cannot find the `loolwsd.xml` file, you can create it in the typical configuration directory (`/etc/loolwsd/`). Here's how:

1. **Create Directory** (if it doesn’t exist):

   ```bash
   sudo mkdir -p /etc/loolwsd
   ```

2. **Create `loolwsd.xml`**:

   Use a text editor to create or edit the `loolwsd.xml` file:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/loolwsd/loolwsd.xml
   ```

   Add the following basic configuration template to the file:

   ```xml
   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <oor:document xmlns:oor="http://openoffice.org/namespace/loolwsd">
       <host>
           <domain>n.example.com</domain>
           <maxClients>200</maxClients>
           <maxInstances>20</maxInstances>
           <disable_ssl>true</disable_ssl>
       </host>
   </oor:document>
   ```

   Make sure to adjust the `domain` to match your setup and set `disable_ssl` to `true` if you are not using HTTPS.

3. **Save and Exit**:

   If you’re using `nano`, press `CTRL + X`, then `Y` to confirm, and `Enter` to save.

### 4. Restart the Collabora Service

After creating or updating the configuration file, restart the Collabora service to apply the changes:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart loolwsd
```

### 5. Verify the Installation

After restarting the service, you can check the status to ensure it’s running correctly:

```bash
sudo systemctl status loolwsd
```

### 6. Test Again

Try accessing the documents in Nextcloud once more to see if the issue persists.
